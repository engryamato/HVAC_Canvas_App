# Project Management User Journeys

This section is split by delivery mode:

- `tauri-offline/` - Tauri-only, offline-first journeys (File system storage)
- `hybrid/` - Hybrid Tauri/Web journeys (local storage + cloud support)

Each folder contains the complete user journey documentation for that specific platform.
