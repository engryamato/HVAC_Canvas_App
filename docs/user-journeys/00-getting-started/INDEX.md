# Getting Started User Journeys

This section is split by delivery mode:

- `tauri-offline/` - Tauri-only, offline-first journeys (Documents folder storage only)
- `hybrid/` - Hybrid Tauri journeys (local storage + cloud backup)

Each folder contains the same baseline journey documents and will diverge as we align storage, onboarding, and recovery flows to the respective runtime model.
