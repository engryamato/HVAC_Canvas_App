# Canvas Calculations Context Plan

## Goal
Document the purpose, data points, and states of **all** UI elements (both macro and micro) in the `Canvas_Calculations.pen` file into a comprehensive `docs/Pencil/Canvas/Calculations/README.md`.

## Tasks
- [x] Task 1: Document Global Canvas Shell (Menu Header, App Logo, Breadcrumb: Dashboard > Zone) -> Verify: `README.md` includes the "Global UI Shell" section.
- [x] Task 2: Document Canvas Viewport Controls (Minimap, Zoom ±, X/Y Cursor Coordinates, Grid/Snap toggles) -> Verify: `README.md` explains canvas interaction indicators.
- [x] Task 3: Document Application Context (Service Context Strip: Service, System, Zone) -> Verify: `README.md` explains the system filtering context.
- [x] Task 4: Document Sidebar Navigation & Inspector States ("No Selection" hint vs Populated "Duct Properties" inputs) -> Verify: `README.md` details the empty vs active inspector states.
- [x] Task 5: Document Calculation Status & Units (Recalculation timing, Error/Warning counters) -> Verify: `README.md` includes status calculation logic.
- [x] Task 6: Document Equipment Hierarchy Visualizer (Tree branches, node statuses, Online/Belt slip/Stable text) -> Verify: `README.md` explains the visual air path indicators.
- [x] Task 7: Document Real-time Duct Metrics & Thresholds (Air Volume, Velocity, Static/Dynamic Pressure, Warnings/Color codes) -> Verify: `README.md` details metric boundaries and footer hints.

## Done When
- [x] `docs/Pencil/Canvas/Calculations/README.md` covers every UI piece from the `.pen` file.
- [x] Context documentation clearly separates interactive states (e.g., populated vs unpopulated).
