# Populate empty README.md with project overview and quick links

## Overview

The main README.md file at the project root contains only the title '# HVAC_Canvas_App' with no content. This is the first file visitors see on GitHub and should provide a comprehensive project overview, badges, installation instructions, screenshots, and links to detailed documentation.

## Rationale

README.md is the primary entry point for all developers, contributors, and users discovering the project. An empty README creates a poor first impression and forces visitors to dig through the docs/ folder to understand what the project does. HVAC estimators evaluating this tool would immediately bounce without context.
