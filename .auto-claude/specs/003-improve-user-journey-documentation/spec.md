# Quick Spec: Improve User Journey Documentation

## Overview

Enhance the existing `docs/UserJourney.md` to provide comprehensive coverage of the complete user experience in the HVAC Canvas App, including dashboard navigation, project management, canvas editing, and export workflows.

## Workflow Type

Simple documentation enhancement - single file modification with content additions.

## Task Scope

- **Target File**: `docs/UserJourney.md`
- **Type of Change**: Content expansion and structural improvement
- **Services Affected**: Documentation only (no code changes)

### Changes Required

1. **Add Table of Contents** - Quick navigation to different journey sections
2. **Add Dashboard Journey** - Project list view, creating/opening/deleting projects
3. **Add Project Management Journey** - Naming, saving, auto-save functionality
4. **Add Export Journey** - Export menu, PDF/image export options
5. **Improve Structure** - Break into clear sections with headers for easier navigation

### Constraints

- Keep the existing canvas journey content (it's comprehensive and well-written)
- Match the existing documentation style with file/code references
- Reference relevant components mentioned in the `/docs/elements/` documentation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Document covers full user journey from app launch to export
- [ ] Table of contents links work correctly
- [ ] All major features are documented with clear step-by-step flows
- [ ] Document is well-organized and easy to navigate
- [ ] Existing canvas editor content is preserved intact

## Files to Modify

- `docs/UserJourney.md` - Expand with additional user journeys and improve structure

## Reference Files

- `docs/elements/01-components/dashboard/ProjectCard.md`
- `docs/elements/01-components/export/ExportMenu.md`

## Notes

- This is a documentation-only task with no impact on application code
- The existing canvas journey documentation is high quality and should be preserved
